* When the app is initially started, the QR code is not displayed, instead there is a message stating that the cart is empty.
* Once the user increments the quantity of an item, the message disappears, but they still have to click the 'place order' button for the QR code to show up.
* If a QR code is displayed, and the users clears their cart, the QR code disappears.
* If a users clicks on 'place order', but they have not added any items to their cart, the QR code is not displayed and the warning message appears.
* However if the user selects and item, presses 'place order', and then adds another item, the previous qr code will not be regenerated until 'place order' button is clicked again.
